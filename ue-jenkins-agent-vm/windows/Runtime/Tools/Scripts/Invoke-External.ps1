# Helper function for invoking an external utility (executable).
# The raison d'Ãªtre for this function is to allow 
# calls to external executables via their *full paths* to be mocked in Pester.

  # Any writes to the command's stderr will be displayed as such, for the first message:
  #  <commandname> : <message>
  #      + CategoryInfo          : NotSpecified: (<message>  :String) [], RemoteException
  #      + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandError 
  # ... and further stderr prints will be just the messages themselves, but still colored in red.
  #
  # Stdout and stderr will be interleaved in the correct order.
